# Intelligent Tutoring System for Math
This project is a prototype ITS for teaching students shape formulas, developed as part of the MSc AI assignment.

## Features:
- Interactive UI built using Streamlit.
- Data and OWL integration for formulas, calculations, and shapes.

## Steps to Run:
1. Install Python and Streamlit.
2. Run the app using `streamlit run app.py`.

## Future Developments:
- Integration with advanced ontology-based logic.
- Real-time calculations using OWL data.
